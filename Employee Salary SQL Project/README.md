ðŸ“Š Employee Salary Insights Project

This project uses SQL to analyze employee and salary data stored in two relational tables: employees and salary_history.

The employees table contains core details such as employee ID, name, joining date, and department.

The salary_history table tracks historical salary changes, dates of change, and whether the change was due to a promotion.

SQL queries are written to extract meaningful insights, such as salary trends, promotion frequency, and department-wise analysis. This project serves as a practical example of working with structured data to derive business intelligence.
