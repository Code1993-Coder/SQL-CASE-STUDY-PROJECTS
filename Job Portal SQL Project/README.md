🗃️ Portal User & Resume Insights Project

This project analyzes user activity and resume data across multiple job portals using SQL.

The portal table contains information about different job portals, including portal codes and names.

The user_registration table tracks when users register on each portal, including subscription details and timestamps.

The resume_doc table stores resume metadata such as creation dates and years of experience.

SQL queries are used to uncover meaningful insights like user registration trends, subscription behavior, portal performance, and resume experience patterns. 
The project demonstrates how structured data can be leveraged for user behavior analysis and strategic decision-making.
